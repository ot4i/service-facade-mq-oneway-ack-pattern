	<h1 class="topictitle1">Error subflow for the <span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: one-way with 
	acknowledgment</span> pattern</h1>
	<p class="shortdesc">This subflow tests whether an error message must be written, which is determined 
	by the user-defined property: <span class="msobjprop">ErrorLoggingOn</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have configured the pattern parameters to include error messages and the user-defined property: 
<span class="msobjprop">ErrorLoggingOn</span> is selected, an error message is prepared and written to the 
error queue.
<p>Details of the exception are written as an XML message. These details include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Broker name</li>
	<li>Flow name</li>
	<li>Time stamp</li>
	<li>Summary of the exception data</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The summary of the exception data contains the message flow label, error number, text description, 
	and a list of inserts giving further details.</p>
</li>
<li>If the message to the provider has been written and a reply sent to the requester, no further action 
is taken.</li> 
<li>If the message to the provider has not been written, an exception is produced that causes a SOAP fault 
to be returned to the requester.</li>
