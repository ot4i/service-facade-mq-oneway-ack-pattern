	Use the 
	<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: one-way with acknowledgment</span> 
	pattern to present a web service interface to clients and to fulfill the service 
	requests by using a WebSphere MQ enabled application.
	</p>
	<p>
	Use this pattern to bridge the asynchronous HTTP protocols and reliable 
	messaging protocols to handle updates with an assurance that requests are 
	saved for processing. 
	</p>
	<p>
	This pattern provides loose coupling between requesters and providers in timing,  
	protocols, and transport. It is appropriate for service 
	interfaces to existing systems.

		<h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
	The solution is to implement a message flow that provides a service entry point. 
	When a web service request is received over HTTP the data is placed as a 
	persistent message on a queue for the provider application. When the message is 
	placed, an acknowledgment is returned to confirm that the request has been 
	accepted. If a client receives an acknowledgment, the message 
	has been written to the queue. If a fault is received, no message 
	has been sent, however, if the fault is a time out, the case is indeterminate, but 
	client applications are aware that a problem exists.
