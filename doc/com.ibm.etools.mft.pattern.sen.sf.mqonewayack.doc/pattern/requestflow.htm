	Details about the Request flow, including logging and exceptions, for the 
	<span>Service Facade to WebSphere MQ: one-way with acknowledgment</span> pattern.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			A SOAP request is received by a SOAP node. If validation is 
			required by the pattern parameters, the request is validated.
		</li>
		<li>
			The SOAP and HTTP headers are removed to leave the basic XML message targeted 
			at the provider application.
		</li>
		<li>
			The message then passes to a request processing subflow, which provides a place 
			for the customization of a pattern instance.
		</li>
		<li>
			Any exception occurring up to this point is caught and causes a SOAP fault to be 
			returned to the caller. The request is not processed after the fault 
			has been sent.
		</li>
		<li>
			If no exceptions occur, the message is written as a persistent message to the 
			input queue of the provider and is committed. The flow is structured so that if the 
			write is successful, any subsequent exceptions do not cause a response to 
			the requester that indicates that the message was not sent. However, it is still possible that 
			the timeout on the SOAP node might cause a SOAP timeout fault to be returned.
		</li>
		<li>
			A positive acknowledgment is returned to the requester as a SOAP Reply. 
			This response contains a single acknowledgment with the string <tt>Accepted</tt>.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you require logging of requests and the message flow succeeds, the 
			logging subflow is called to log the incoming message.
		</li>
		<li>
			If an exception occurs after the message is written, when building and 
			sending the acknowledgment, and if error messages are required by the pattern 
			parameters, the error subflow is called to record the error and the subflow 
			ends successfully. Because the message persists on the provider queue 
			this error is for information only, not for data persistence, and the body of the 
			message is not included. If error messages are not required by the pattern 
			parameters, the flow ends successfully.
		</li>
